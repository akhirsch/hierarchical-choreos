Functional choreographic programming suggests a new propositions-as-types paradigm might be possible.
In this new paradigm, communication is not modeled linearly; instead, ownership of a piece of data is modeled as a modality, and communication is change of modality.
Doxastic logics, or logics of belief, appear to be a promising logical counterpart.
In particular, authorization logics, which are doxastic logics with explicit communication, appear to represent hierarchical choreographic programming, a new paradigm that I will describe in this talk.
