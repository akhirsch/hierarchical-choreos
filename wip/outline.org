#+TITLE: A Modal Propositions-As-Types Principle for Choreographic and Multitier Programming (Abstract)


* Intro
** Doxastic Logic
*** Multiagent logic of belief
**** Concurrent intuition: Different agents as threads
**** Natural fit for global paradigms
*** Beliefs about Beliefs
**** "Alice believes that Bob believes that ..."
**** Challenge: What does this mean in the concurrent interpretation
**** N.B.: Alice's Bob is completely separate from Bob
***** Distinguishes Doxastic from Epistemic logic
** Communication and Authorization Logic
*** Second challenge: Lack of communication primitives
*** Communication implicitly occurs between an agent and their process
**** In a PaT interpretation of "Alice believes (Bob believes Phi)", Alice has access to some resource representing Bob believing Phi
*** Authorization logic adds explicit communication
**** Used to reason about security policies in distributed systems
**** Speaksfor (static) as channels
**** Speaksfor-elim as communication
*** Nested Beliefs and Hierarchical Computing
**** Nested Beliefs create a tree structure on agents
**** Idea: hierarchical computing as a PaT interpretation
***** Examples: threads on nodes, server farms, owner-worker topologies...
**** Authorization-logic speaksfor as choreographic send
**** Self-knowledge and Multitier programming
*** This talk
**** Calculus for PaT Hierarchical Computing
***** WIP!
**** Logical Conjectures
**** Computational Conjectures
* Doxastic Logic & Authorization Logic
** Believes modality
*** Represents 
* A Hierarchical Choreographic Calculus
